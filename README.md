# 📈 Documenting Growth

## 📌 Introduction

### 💡 Thought Process

I took on this task as an opportunity to **improve my skills and push myself to the next level** in frontend development. The first step was to analyze the **mistakes** I made during my initial submission.

I conducted a detailed **rundown** of the project and identified areas for improvement:

- **Design Quality** – Enhancing UI/UX consistency.
- **Functionality Completion** – Prioritizing core features over minor tweaks.
- **Animations** – Improving smoothness and performance using **Next.js, Tailwind, and Framer Motion**.
- **Testing** – Implementing proper **unit and integration tests** for better reliability.

The **feedback** I received provided clear direction, helping me pinpoint where to improve.

## 📅 Project Plan & Execution

I set a **personal deadline of 5 days** and created a **structured roadmap**, focusing on one functionality per day:

### 🔹 Breakdown of Development Phases

1️⃣ **Day 1: Splash Screen** – UI design + animation research.

2️⃣ **Day 2: Banner Section** – Implementing transitions & optimizing.

3️⃣ **Day 3: About Section + Image Slider** – Refining interactivity.

4️⃣ **Day 4: Optimization** – Removing unused code & improving performance.

5️⃣ **Day 5: Testing & Final Touches** – Learning & implementing **Jest + React Testing Library**.

### 🛠 Process Followed for Each Section

✔ **Step 1:** Build the **base UI**.

✔ **Step 2:** Work on **animations & interactions**.

- This was **challenging** as I was new to Tailwind-based animations.
- Required **extensive research** on CSS properties, **trial & error**, and **timing synchronization**.

✔ **Step 3:** Optimize the **codebase**, making it cleaner and more efficient.

⏳ **Note:** Some sections took longer than expected due to **unexpected errors**, but I successfully adapted and managed to stay within my deadline.

## 🧪 Testing & New Learnings

I had **zero prior experience** in frontend testing, so I had to **learn it from scratch** before implementation.

- Went through **learning materials** on Jest & React Testing Library.
- Experimented with **unit and integration tests** through **trial & error**.
- Successfully implemented **basic test cases** in my project.
- **Next Goal:** Dive deeper into Cypress for **E2E testing**.

## 🎯 Personal Reflection

These **5 days** have been **transformative** for me.

- It exposed me to **new technologies** and methodologies.
- Helped me push **beyond my comfort zone**.
- I was driven by the **adrenaline rush**, but the **learnings were invaluable**.
