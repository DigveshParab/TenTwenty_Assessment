# TenTwenty_Assessment

## Project Description

This project is a technical assessment for the role of Frontend Developer at TenTwenty. It is a single-page application built using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The application is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to both smaller and larger screens while maintaining a design that adjusts dynamically based on screen type.



## Motivation Behind Choosing This Stack

I have been learning **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for over two weeks now, making me relatively new to this stack. The reason I chose it is that during my conversation with the recruiter, she mentioned that this role specifically requires **Next.js** development. 

Even though I am a beginner, I took this as a challenge to test my skills and boost my confidence by building this project using the required stack.



## Challenges I Faced and The Lessions I Learned

### 1. Setting Up the Project from Scratch  
The project requirement stated that everything needed to be set up **completely from scratch**. This was a real **head-scratcher** because, up until now, all my Next.js projects used commands that installed a **boilerplate** for me. Since I am still new to **Next.js**, manually setting up the project was a bit challenging.  

**Solution:**  
I managed to **set up the project from scratch** and, in the process, learned some important things about Next.js. I discovered that there are **two types of setups**:  
- **Page Router** (which was the old method and is no longer used from version 13+).  
- **App Router** (the latest method used in modern Next.js applications).  

This experience made me more **familiar with the Next.js file structure** and gave me a deeper understanding of how things work under the hood.

### 2. Tailwind CSS Setup & Workflow  
Since I had to **manually set up Tailwind CSS**, I ran into a couple of issues:  

#### **a) Configuration Issue**  
After installing the Tailwind package, I **wasn't able to configure it** the way I had done previously (by adding `base`, `components`, and `utils` modules).  

**Solution:**  
After spending some time reading the **official documentation**, I realized that **from Tailwind v4 onwards**, this method is no longer required. Instead, **just importing Tailwind into `global.css` is enough**. Turns out, it all came down to **a single line of code** ðŸ˜….  

#### **b) Getting Familiar with Tailwindâ€™s Workflow**  
Initially, I was a bit **slow at writing Tailwind classes**, but as I progressed, I got the hang of it.  

**What I learned:**  
- I can now **visualize** which built-in classes to use instead of constantly referring to the documentation.  
- **Trial and error** helped me experiment and understand how different utility classes work.  
- I got better at setting up **responsive breakpoints** for different devices, which means **goodbye, `@media` queries!** ðŸŽ‰  



### 3. Understanding "Pixel Perfect"  
When I first read the guidelines, the term **"pixel perfect"** was **completely foreign to me**. At first, I thought it had something to do with the **quality of images** used in the project (**me thinking it was related to image resolution ðŸ˜‚**).  

**Solution:**  
After researching the term and trying out the **Pixel Perfect extension**, I was **amazed** to see that such a tool exists! It allowed me to **overlay the design on my implementation** to ensure **precise alignment**. This was a **game-changer**, and I can definitely see myself using this tool in future projects to improve design accuracy.  




## What I Take Away From This Project  

### 1. Confidence & Learning  
At the end of this **48-hour challenge**, I feel I have **gained confidence** and **acquired a lot of new knowledge** in **Next.js and Tailwind CSS**. This is just the beginning, and I will **continue to push myself further** in mastering these technologies.  

### 2. Taking on Challenges  
This project has helped me **build confidence in taking up new challenges** and **delivering within a given time frame**. It reinforced my ability to **learn quickly and adapt**, which I find crucial for growth in this industry.  

### 3. Motivation to Work with Next.js & Tailwind  
This experience has **greatly motivated me** to work more with **Next.js and Tailwind CSS**. They are **powerful tools**, and working on this project has **helped me improve more than just watching tutorials**. I now have **hands-on experience** with real-world development challenges, and I better understand **what the industry demands**. This has inspired me to **further upskill and refine my abilities**.
